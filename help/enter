It's used to enter already running container. Syntax should look like:

docker/enter [<options>] <env>:<service> [sh|bash] [<command>] [<args...>]

- options           - same options provided by `docker-compose exec -h`
- <env>:<service>   - to run some command inside php service in dev environment we would write `dev:php`
- sh|bash           - sh is default
- command           - command you want to run in running service
- args              - arguments you want to add to command

If command is not provided it will enter provided container. This command does not have any special flavors.

Examples:

docker/enter dev:php                        # enter already running php container
docker/enter --user root dev:php            # enter already running php container as root user
docker/enter dev:php composer install       # enter already running php container, run command `composer install` and exit
