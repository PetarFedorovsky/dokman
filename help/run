It's used for running one time scripts/tasks. Syntax should look like:

docker/run [<options>] <env>:<service> [sh|bash] [<command>] [<args...>]

- options           - options that can be passed to change behavior of container, all `docker-compose run -h` options are
supported (two of them are turn on by default       --no-deps and --rm)
- <env>:<service>   - to run some command inside php service in dev environment we would write `dev:php`
- sh|bash           - sh is default
- command           - any command that wou want to run on your container
- args              - arguments that you want to send to your command

By default run will not load linked containers and will remove container after run. If you do not provide any command and
arguments, you will enter container.

Special flavored options:
- --deps    - will turn off default --no-deps switch
- --no-rm   - will turn off default --rm switch

Note: Notice special syntax for writing env and service delimited by :.

Examples:

docker/run dev:node yarn run build:development      # create node container form dev environment, run command `yarn run build:development` and exit 
docker/run dev:node                                 # create node container form dev environment and enter it
docker/run --user root dev:node                     # create node container form dev environment, login as root user
dokcer/run --user root -w /tmp dev:node             # create node container form dev environment, login as root user to /tmp directory
dokcer/run dev:node bash                            # create node container form dev environment, login to bash
