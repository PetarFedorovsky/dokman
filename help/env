As `env` command is a wrapper for `docker-compose` it has almost the same API as `docker-compose`. You can
up, down, stop, see logs and so on. Syntax should look like:

docker/env <env> <command> [<args>]

- env           - name of your environment
- command       - one of `docker-compose` commands (to see list of all available commands run `docker-compose -h`)
- args          - arguments of provided `docker-compose` command (to see list of all available arguments of one command run
`dokcer-compose <command> -h`)

Special flavored commands:
- on - will run `dokcer-compose up --build --no-recreate -d` as shorthand with additional calling of event scripts
- off - will run `dokcer-compose down` as shorthand with additional calling of event scripts


Examples:

docker/env dev on               # special command for upping containers
docker/env dev off              # special command for downing containers
docker/env dev build            # build dev environment
docker/env dev up               # up all containers in dev environment in detach mode
docker/env dev ps               # list all containers in dev environment
docker/env dev logs             # show logs of all running containers
docker/env dev logs php         # show only logs of php container
docker/env dev logs -f php      # tail -f logs of php container
docker/env dev kill php         # kill php container
docker/env dev restart          # restart all containers
docker/env dev restart php      # restart only php container
